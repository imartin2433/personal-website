            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              I'm Ishmael Martin, a recent computer science graduate from
              Western Governor University with a strong foundation in
              programming languages like Python, Java, and C++. I'm well-versed
              in web development frameworks like Django and React. As a software
              engineer, I am eager to apply my technical skills and
              problem-solving abilities to contribute to innovative projects.
              With a passion for continuous learning and a dedication to
              excellence, I'm excited to embark on a rewarding career in
              software engineering.

            <p><em>WGU Parcel Service |</em> Python</p>
            <p>
              I developed a program for Western Governors University Parcel
              Service (WGUPS) to optimize route and delivery distribution for
              Salt Lake City Daily Local Deliveries (DLD). By utilizing the
              nearest neighbors algorithm, I determined the shortest routes for
              trucks, considering package constraints and delivery deadlines.
              Additionally, I implemented a hashtable data structure to enhance
              the routing system's performance through fast lookup and insertion
              of package and address information. This resulted in timely and
              efficient package deliveries.

            <p><em>Student System Migration |</em> C++</p>
            <p>
              I developed a C++ application to migrate an existing student
              system to a new platform. The implementation included five classes
              (Student, SecurityStudent, NetworkStudent, SoftwareStudent, and
              Roster) for reading, manipulating, and storing student data, along
              with functions for adding/removing students, printing info,
              calculating average course duration, and validating emails.
            </p>

            <p><em>Munera |</em> Python, Django, Docker, Bootstrap</p>
            <p>
              I developed Munera, a captivating web application that allowed
              users to create personalized gift lists and easily share them with
              others. Additionally, I successfully implemented a group
              functionality within the application, enabling seamless secret
              Santa assignments for gift exchanges among participants.
